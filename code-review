David Hoang CS 202 Assignment 1
Code Review for 18.16

For this assignment the userinput in the form of a string will always be converted into an array of characters.

Then the method will tally up how many uppercase letters there are. 

To my knowledge even if the user enters in a non alphabet character the program will still function properly.

In this code review perhaps in the next iteration of this program we can do some error handling checks to make sure that all userinput is 
an alphabet letter. AKA no special characters or numbers for example because they cannot be classified as uppercase or not.

However, this might not be the true requirement of the problem. This is an assumption.
